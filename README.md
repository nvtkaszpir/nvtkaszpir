# About me

Hi, I'm Michał, or in just call me Mike.
How to reach me, don't expect a reply though:

* kaszpir at google.com - preferred communication channel
* Slack: _KaszpiR_ @ kubernetes on `#pl-users` channel, [link](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C4W6MFCEB)
* IRC - freenode/quakenet nick: `_KaszpiR_`
* twitter: [`_KaszpiR_`](https://twitter.com/_KaszpiR_)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/micha%C5%82-socho%C5%84-46724233/)

Yeah, I'm kinda non-social guy.

Below is what I do for a living:

* Consulting / support / development / implementation of network design & infrastructure and operations among various projects, often based on multiple public clouds such as AWS/GCP and on-premises.
* Cloud migrations with various scopes - from basic ‘lift and shift’, through replacing subset of services with cloud vendored solutions, up to full reimplementations from scratch.
* Redesigning systems when moving to the containers: analysis if the app is applicable to be containerized, creating container pipelines, creating packages for deployment (for example helm charts).
* Setting up full CI/CD stacks: application pipelines, infrastructure automation pipelines, mixed with monitoring and eye-candy graphs (management loves the colors and money in the same picture!).
* Cost estimation with capacity planning, automating dynamic resource allocations based on metrics.
