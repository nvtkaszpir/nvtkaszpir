# About me

Hi, I'm Michał, or in just call me Mike.
How to reach me, don't expect a reply though:

* kaszpir at google.com - preferred communication channel
* Slack: `_KaszpiR_` @ kubernetes on `#pl-users` channel, [link](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C4W6MFCEB)
* Discord - [Quake.World](http://discord.quake.world/) nick: `_KaszpiR_`
* IRC - LiberaChat/OFTC/QuakeNet nick: `_KaszpiR_`
* twitter: [`_KaszpiR_`](https://twitter.com/_KaszpiR_) (yeah, I'm not really using it )
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%F0%9F%90%BB-micha%C5%82-socho%C5%84-46724233/)

Below is what I do for a living:

* Consulting / support / development / implementation of network design & infrastructure and operations among various projects, often based on multiple public clouds such as AWS/GCP and on-premises.
* Cloud migrations with various scopes - from basic ‘lift and shift’, through replacing subset of services with cloud vendored solutions, up to full reimplementations from scratch.
* Redesigning systems when moving to the containers: analysis if the app is applicable to be containerized, creating container pipelines, creating packages for deployment (for example helm charts).
* Setting up full CI/CD stacks: application pipelines, infrastructure automation pipelines, mixed with monitoring and eye-candy graphs (management loves the colors and money in the same picture!).
* Cost estimation with capacity planning, automating dynamic resource allocations based on metrics.

# Presentations

* Java on Kubernetes: problems and fixes related to HBase/Hadoop - [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcFlHmMJ1Qo), [slides](https://nvtkaszpir.github.io/presentations-java-in-k8s-hbase-hdfs/#/) - 2020, in polish, how to put elephants into containers

# Repos

Of course a lot of code goes to other private repos owned by the clients, unless things could go to upstream repos, so publicly available stuff on my github is usually related to hobbies. Some repos you may be interested in:

* [vagrant-gitlab-runners](https://github.com/nvtkaszpir/vagrant-gitlab-runners) - all you need is bash for GitLab runners in Vagrant
* [workstation](https://github.com/nvtkaszpir/workstation) - provisioning my rusted laptop
* [rpi](https://github.com/nvtkaszpir/rpi) and [rpi-power-button](https://github.com/nvtkaszpir/rpi-power-button) because ignorance causes history to repeat itself
* [docker + buildx](https://github.com/nvtkaszpir/docker-buildx-trash) more like an inspiration for those interested in multi-arch containers
* [dh-chaos](https://github.com/nvtkaszpir/dh-chaos) aka how to waste time waiting for Azure on hackaton while fiddling with chaos-toolkit
* [kind-minefield](https://github.com/nvtkaszpir/kind-minefield) - jenkins pipeline which shows how to prevent your friends from abusing resources on your precious computer, which you keep alive since 2010 in the basement (the computer, not the friends...)
* [devops-sig-8](https://github.com/nvtkaszpir/devops-sig-8) - k8s and config management - how to manage live config updates in pods, see forked repo and its branches for more!
* [python-github-create-issue](https://github.com/nvtkaszpir/python-github-create-issue) - use python script to create issue from CLI, useful in certain CI systems (but I bet no one uses it)


# Currently interested in

* general automation like Puppet / Ansible / SaltStack
* various clouds - especially AWS / GCP
* Kubernetes and it's ecosystem - because we love tools that are not even in alpha
* improving system's resilience via chaos engineering
* scalability issues within ETL systems

# Hobbies

* self driving cars - see [DonkeyCar](https://www.donkeycar.com/)
* sometimes gibbing people with rocket launcher - I wish I were midairing people in endif [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv_KDPXw_3U).
