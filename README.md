# About me

Hi, I'm Michał, or in just call me Mike.
How to reach me, don't expect a reply though:

* kaszpir at google.com - preferred communication channel
* Slack: `_KaszpiR_` @ kubernetes on `#pl-users` channel, [link](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C4W6MFCEB)
* Discord - [Quake.World](http://discord.quake.world/) nick: `_KaszpiR_`
  but make sure to highlight me or message me directly
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%F0%9F%90%BB-micha%C5%82-socho%C5%84-46724233/)

Not used that much:

* IRC - LiberaChat/OFTC/QuakeNet nick: `_KaszpiR_`
* twitter: [`_KaszpiR_`](https://twitter.com/_KaszpiR_)
  (yeah, I really never used that )

Below is what I do for a living:

* Consulting / support / development / implementation of network design
  & infrastructure and operations among various projects, often based on
  multiple public clouds such as AWS/GCP and on-premises.
* Cloud migrations with various scopes - from basic ‘lift and shift’,
  through replacing subset of services with cloud vendored solutions,
  up to full reimplementations from scratch.
* Redesigning systems when moving to the containers: analysis if the app is
  applicable to be containerized, creating container pipelines,
  creating packages for deployment (for example helm charts).
* Setting up full CI/CD stacks: application pipelines, infrastructure automation
  pipelines, mixed with monitoring and eye-candy graphs
  (management loves the colors and money in the same picture!).
* Cost estimation with capacity planning, automating dynamic resource
  allocations based on metrics.
* Pointy-haired Boss: - `Kubernetes`

# Currently interested in

* observability - Prometheus / Tracing etc
* various clouds - especially AWS / GCP
* Kubernetes and it's ecosystem - because we love tools that are not even in alpha
* improving system's resilience via chaos engineering, but fear not,
  devs and users are always better at that ;)
* scalability issues within ETL systems

# Hobbies

* some simple electronics and automation, for example
  * [esphome](https://esphome.io/index.html)
  * [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/)
  * [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)
  * and others
* 3D Printing (mainly related to filament based ones like Prusa Mini+)
* sometimes gibbing people with rocket launcher -
  I wish I were midairing people in endif [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv_KDPXw_3U).
